# simNet
Implementation of "simNet: Stepwise Image-Topic Merging Network for Generating Detailed and Comprehensive Image Captions"

### Requirements
This code is written in Python2.7 and requires Torch 0.3

You need to download pre-trained Resnet152 model from [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) for both training and evaluation. 

You can have a look at https://github.com/s-gupta/visual-concepts to get topic words
### Training a simNet model
Now we can train our simNet model with 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2,3 screen python train.py
```

### Testing a trained model
We can test our simNet model with 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2,3 screen python test.py
```
### Note
If you have any questions about the code or our paper, please send an email to "lfl@bupt.edu.cn"
